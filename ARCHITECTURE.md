# ARCHITECTURE — mentci

Mentci is a first-class component daemon that hosts the programmable approval
surface for the local criome.

## Engines

Signal is external and lives in the two contract repos:

- `signal-mentci` is the working signal for programmable UI requests,
  responses, and events.
- `meta-signal-mentci` is the daemon configuration and reconfiguration signal.

This repo carries the daemon-local engines:

- `schema/nexus.schema` is the internal operations vocabulary. It reacts to
  arrived signal requests, commands SEMA writes and reads, frames criome
  escalations into questions, admits edited-answer proposals, routes closed
  verdicts, and publishes projected interface state to subscribers.
- `schema/sema.schema` is the durable state vocabulary. It defines the pending
  question family, decision family, edited-answer proposal family,
  subscription family, and singleton revision family.

## State Flow

`PresentQuestion` arrives through `signal-mentci`. Nexus commands the SEMA to
admit the question, minting a daemon-local identifier and bumping the
interface revision. The daemon then publishes projected state to matching
subscribers. Answering a question records one of the closed verdicts; editing a
suggestion admits a new typed answer proposal object instead of answering the
original question directly.

## Current Status

The first runtime slice is bootstrapped against canonical remote contract
crates, not local path dependencies:

- `mentci-daemon` takes exactly one binary startup file. The file is a
  length-prefixed `meta-signal-mentci` frame whose input payload is
  `Configure(MentciDaemonConfiguration)`.
- `mentci` is the thin CLI client. It takes exactly one request input: a
  length-prefixed binary `signal-mentci` frame file, a `.nota` request file, or
  inline NOTA text. It connects to the local daemon socket and writes the binary
  reply frame to stdout.
- The daemon speaks `signal-mentci` over Unix sockets with the shared
  `signal-frame` envelope and generated rkyv/NOTA nouns.
- The current SEMA implementation is in-memory. It is the executable shape of
  the daemon state machine, not yet the durable persisted family.

The remaining production gaps are durable SEMA storage, notification fan-out
events beyond request/reply, and cryptographic verdict egress through criome
key custody. Those are integration gaps around the runtime slice, not blockers
to the contract-shaped daemon boot.
