# Sema-ecosystem architecture

*Living document · last revision 2026-04-24 · canonical reference for the engine's shape*

## Scope rule (READ FIRST)

This file is **high-level concepts only**. Three layers of
documentation, strictly separated:

| Where | What | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/architecture.md` | **Prose + diagrams only.** No code. High-level shape, invariants, relationships, rules. | "criomed owns sema; lojix-stored owns lojix-store; text crosses only at nexusd" |
| `reports/NNN-*.md` | **Concrete shapes + decision records.** Type sketches, record definitions, message enums, research syntheses, historical context. | `Opus { … }` full rkyv sketch |
| the repos themselves | **Implementation.** Rust code, tests, flakes, Cargo.toml. | `nexus-schema/src/opus.rs` |

**If a doc-layer rule is violated**, rewrite: move type sketches
out of `docs/architecture.md` into a report; move runnable code
out of reports into the appropriate repo. This file stays slim
so it remains readable in one pass.

When architecture changes, update this file first, then write a
new report explaining the change. Don't edit old reports —
they're decision-journey records.

## 1 · The engine in one paragraph

**sema is the truth.** At any instant, the records in sema are
the current, evaluated, canonical state — there is no separate
layer above sema that holds "computed values" apart from what
sema already contains. Every message that reaches the engine
can potentially edit sema; rules and derivations are themselves
records in sema; when an edit cascades, the cascade settles as
more sema records. This is the whole point of the design: one
store of truth, one way to change it, full introspection.

**Sema holds code as logic, not text.** The record kinds in
sema describe *semantic structure* — `Fn`, `Struct`, `Enum`,
`Module`, `Expr`, `Type`, `Signature`, … (see
[reports/004](../reports/004-sema-types-for-rust.md)). Sema
never contains source bytes, token streams, or abstract syntax
trees as records. Text is either transport (nexus syntax ↔
record trees at nexusd's boundary) or projection (records → `.rs`
via rsc when rustc needs to consume bytes). An entire class of
rustc errors (`unresolved import`, `cannot find type in this
scope`) doesn't exist in sema because references are
content-hash IDs and invalid references are rejected at
mutation time. See
[reports/026](../reports/026-sema-is-code-as-logic.md).

Three daemons work around that invariant:

- **nexusd** — the translator: nexus text ↔ rkyv at the human
  boundary.
- **criomed** — sema's engine: receives every message, applies
  mutations, lets rules cascade, maintains invariants,
  dispatches concrete work to lojixd.
- **lojixd** — the hands: does what sema can't (spawns cargo /
  nix / nixos-rebuild subprocesses; reads and writes the
  lojix-store blob directory; materialises files). Its inputs
  are plan records read from sema; its outputs become outcome
  records written back.

The MVP target is **self-hosting**: the engine's own source
lives as records in sema; editing those records cascades through
sema into concrete plan records; lojixd executes the plans;
resulting binaries can re-edit the same records.

     │          │ • executes; writes binary into lojix-store
     │          │   (in-process)
     │          │ • replies {output-hash, warnings, wall_ms}
     └──────────┘
```

**Invariants**:

- Text crosses only at nexusd's boundary.
- No daemon-to-daemon path routes bulk data through criomed —
  forged and lojix-stored are connected directly, authorised by
  a criomed-signed capability token.
- Criomed never sees compiled binary bytes; it only records
  their hashes in sema.
- There is no `Launch` protocol message. Binaries are
  materialised to filesystem paths (nix-store style); you run
  them from a shell.

---

## 3 · The two stores

### sema — records database

- **Owner**: criomed.
- **Backend**: content-addressed records, keyed by the blake3
  of their canonical rkyv encoding. Storage engine is an
  embedded redb.
- **Holds**: every structural record (Struct, Enum, Module,
  Program, Opus, Derivation, Type, Origin, traits, …).
- **Writes**: single-writer through criomed's internal writer
  actor.
- **Reads**: parallel, MVCC semantics from the storage engine.
- **Identity of a workspace opus** tracked in a name→root-hash
  table (git-refs analogue).

### lojix-store — content-addressed blobs

- **Owner**: lojix-stored.
- **Backend**: append-only file plus a rebuildable hash-to-
  offset index.
- **Holds**: opaque bytes only (compiled binaries; user file
  attachments referenced by sema records; anything too large or
  too unstructured to belong in sema).
- **No typing**. No kind bytes. The type of a blob is known
  only through the sema record that references its hash.
- **Access control**: capability tokens, signed by criomed.

### Relationship

Sema records carry content-hash fields that reference blobs in
lojix-store. "Record says hash H; fetch H from lojix-stored."
Criomed keeps a reachability view (what hashes are live) and
can direct garbage collection; it never handles the bytes
themselves.

## 4 · Repo layout

~16 code repos + 1 spec-only + `tools-documentation`. **[L]**
marks lojix-family members.

- **Layer 0 — text grammars** — nota (spec), nota-serde-core
  (shared lexer+ser+de kernel), nota-serde (façade), nexus
  (spec), nexus-serde (façade).
- **Layer 1 — schema vocabulary** — nexus-schema (may rename to
  `sema-schema` later): sema records (including Opus,
  Derivation, OpusDep, RustToolchainPin, NarHashSri, FlakeRef,
  OverrideUri, TargetTriple — these are user-written records,
  not a separate lojix schema), pattern types, query ops.
  (A separate `lojix-schema` crate was proposed in report 019
  but superseded by 021 once criomed's incremental evaluator
  took over build-spec resolution.)
- **Layer 2 — contract crates** — criome-msg (nexusd↔criomed),
  lojix-msg **[L]** (criomed↔lojixd; carries **concrete
  execution verbs** — RunCargo / RunNix / RunNixosRebuild /
  PutBlob / GetBlob / MaterializeFiles — not Opus references).
- **Layer 3 — storage** — sema (records DB, backs criomed),
  lojix-store **[L]** (blob directory + reader library — no
  daemon; writes via lojixd, reads via mmap).
- **Layer 4 — daemons** — nexusd (messenger), criomed (guardian),
  lojixd **[L]** (single lojix daemon — forge + store + deploy
  as internal actors).
- **Layer 5 — clients + build libs** — nexus-cli (flag-less
  CLI; the only text client), rsc (pure records-to-source
  library; lojixd links it).
- **Spec-only (terminal state)** — lojix **[L]** (README for
  the namespace; parallels `nexus` and `nota` spec repos).

> **Transitional-state warning**: `/home/li/git/lojix/` is
> *currently* a working Rust crate containing Li's CriomOS
> deploy orchestrator (CLI + ractor actor pipeline). The
> "spec-only" entry above is the **terminal** shape after the
> migration in [reports/030](../reports/030-lojix-transition-plan.md).
> Until Phase F of that plan, the lojix repo's code is
> production infrastructure. Agents must not treat the layout
> above as an instruction to delete the existing crate.

**Lojix family membership** is a second axis orthogonal to
layer. A crate is lojix-family iff it participates in the
content-addressed typed build/store/deploy pipeline (Li's
"expanded nix"). Criteria: carries `NarHashSri`/`FlakeRef`/
artifact records, or drives nix/cargo, or stores opaque blobs,
or is the typed wire for any of those.

### The `lojix-*` namespace — Li's expanded nix

"lojix" is Li's play on nix — "my take on an expanded and more
correct nix." Broad scope: covers everything nix covers
(compile, store, deploy, derive). The prefix is an umbrella; a
crate carrying `lojix-*` participates in the artifacts pillar.

Three-pillar framing:

- **criome** — the runtime (nexusd, criomed, the daemon graph)
- **sema** — records, meaning, schemas, patterns
- **lojix** — artifacts, build, compile, store, deploy

criome ⊇ {sema, lojix}. nexus is the communication skin spanning
all of criome, not a fourth pillar.

**Two axes per daemon**:

| Daemon | Runtime | Family |
|---|---|---|
| `nexusd` | criome | criome (nexus skin) |
| `criomed` | criome | criome |
| `lojixd` | criome | lojix |

All daemons run at the criome-runtime layer; `lojixd` is also
a lojix-family member.

**Shelved**: `arbor` (prolly-tree versioning) — post-MVP.

Concrete record types, message enums, and the rename journey
live in [reports/019](../reports/019-lojix-as-pillar.md),
[reports/017](../reports/017-architecture-refinements.md), and
earlier. This file names the components; it does not define
their shapes.

---

## 5 · Key type families (named, not specified)

- **Opus** — pure-Rust artifact specification. User-written
  sema record. Nix-like and extremely explicit: toolchain
  pinned by derivation reference, outputs enumerated, features
  as plain strings, every build-affecting input a field so
  the record's hash captures the full closure. Lives in
  `nexus-schema`. criomed's incremental evaluator resolves it
  to a concrete RunCargo plan at edit time; lojixd never sees
  the Opus directly.
- **Derivation** — escape hatch for non-pure deps. Wraps a nix
  flake output (or inline nix expression) with a content-hash
  and named outputs. User-written sema record. Lives in
  `nexus-schema`.
- **OpusDep** — opus → {opus | derivation} link spec.
  User-written. Lives in `nexus-schema`.
- **RawPattern** — the wire form of a nexus pattern, carrying
  user-facing names (`StructName`, `FieldName`, `BindName`).
  Appears on criome-msg; never used inside criomed after
  resolution.
- **PatternExpr** — the resolved form, carrying schema IDs
  (`StructId`, `FieldId`). Pinned to a specific sema snapshot.
  Internal to criomed.
- **CriomeRequest / CriomeReply** — the nexusd↔criomed
  protocol verbs (lookup, query, assert, mutate, subscribe,
  compile, …).
- **lojix-msg verbs** — concrete execution instructions in the
  criomed→lojixd direction: RunCargo, RunNix, RunNixosRebuild,
  PutBlob (streaming variants for large payloads), GetBlob,
  ContainsBlob, MaterializeFiles, DeleteBlob (criomed-driven
  GC). Each reply is a result of that concrete operation. No
  `CompileRequest { opus: OpusId }` — that level of abstraction
  is criomed's internal concern.

Concrete field lists live in
[reports/017 §1, §2](../reports/017-architecture-refinements.md)
and subsequent reports. If a type below needs to grow, update
its report (or write a new one); don't inline the shape here.

## 6 · Data flow

### Single query

```
 human nexus text
        ▼
  nexusd: lex + parse → RawPattern
        │ rkyv criome-msg (Query { pattern })
        ▼
  criomed: resolver(RawPattern, sema_snapshot) → PatternExpr
        │ matcher runs against records
        ▼
  rkyv reply (Records)
        ▼
  nexusd: serialize → nexus text
        ▼
 human
```

### Compile + self-host loop (edit-time + run-time)

**Edit-time** (mutations cascade through sema):
```
 human: (Mutate (Opus nexusd …))
        ▼
 nexusd → criomed
        ▼
 criomed applies the mutation to sema:
   • Opus record updates
   • rules/derivations in sema reference it; the cascade
     settles as updated plan records, dependency records,
     pattern rebindings — all IN sema
   • subscriptions fire
        ▼ (no lojixd yet; sema is the evaluation)
```

**Run-time** (dispatch a plan record):
```
 human: (Compile nexusd)
        ▼
 nexusd → criomed
        ▼
 criomed reads the relevant plan record from sema and
 issues the concrete verb to lojixd:
        ▼ rkyv RunCargo { workdir, args, env, fetch_files, … }
 lojixd:
   • materialises fetch_files from lojix-store into workdir
   • spawns cargo
   • hashes binary; writes into lojix-store (in-process)
   • replies { output-hash, warnings, wall_ms }
        ▼
 criomed writes the outcome back as a sema record
 (e.g. CompiledBinary pointing at the blob hash)
        ▼
 reply flows back to human
```

**Self-host close**: human materialises the new binary to a
filesystem path, runs it; running binary connects to nexusd
and asserts new records; criomed incrementally re-plans; next
compile is different — LOOP CLOSES.

## 7 · Grammar shape

Nota is a strict subset of nexus. A single lexer (in
nota-serde-core) handles both, gated by a dialect knob. The
grammar is organised as a **delimiter-family matrix** (see
[reports/013](../reports/013-nexus-syntax-proposal.md)):

- Outer character picks the family — records `( )`, composites
  `{ }`, evaluation `[ ]`, flow `< >`.
- Pipe count inside picks the abstraction level — none for
  concrete, one for abstracted/pattern, two for
  committed/scoped.

**Sigil budget is closed.** Six total: `;;` (comment), `#`
(byte-literal prefix), `~` (mutate), `@` (bind), `!` (negate),
`=` (bind-alias, narrow use). New features land as delimiter-
matrix slots or Pascal-named records — **never new sigils**.

---

## 8 · Project-wide rules

Foundational rules observed across sessions.

- **No ETAs.** Don't estimate time to complete work. Describe
  the work; don't schedule it.
- **No backward compat.** The engine is being born. Rename,
  move, restructure freely. Applies until Li declares a
  compatibility boundary.
- **Text only crosses nexusd.** Every internal daemon-to-daemon
  message is rkyv.
- **Schema is the documentation.** Patterns and types resolve
  against sema; hallucinated names are rejected early.
- **sema is the truth.** Not a store that an evaluator sits
  above — sema's current contents ARE the evaluated state.
  Rules and derivations are themselves records; mutation
  cascades happen inside sema. criomed is the engine that
  applies mutations and maintains invariants; it doesn't hold a
  separate cache of "derived values."
- **Sema holds code as logic, not text.** Record kinds describe
  semantic structure (`Fn`, `Struct`, `Expr`, `Type`, …). Text
  is transport (nexus syntax at nexusd's boundary) or projection
  (records → `.rs` via rsc). No `SourceRecord`, no
  `TokenStream`, no `Ast` as records. Structural invariants
  (references are content-hash IDs; kinds are schema-validated)
  make a class of rustc errors impossible by construction.
- **lojixd is for effects sema can't do** — spawn processes,
  touch the filesystem, invoke external tools. Its inputs are
  plan records read from sema; its outputs are outcome records
  written back. It never sees an Opus directly; it receives
  concrete execution verbs.
- **Criomed is the overlord** of lojix-store. Tracks
  reachability; signs tokens; directs GC.
- **A binary is just a path.** No `Launch` message;
  materialisation is filesystem.
- **Sigils as last resort.** New features land in the matrix
  or as records. The sigil budget is frozen.
- **One artifact per repo.** rust/style.md rule 1.
- **Content-addressing is non-negotiable.** Record identity is
  the blake3 of its canonical encoding. Don't add mutable
  fields that would break identity.

## 9 · Reading order for a new session

1. **This file** — the canonical shape.
2. [reports/026](../reports/026-sema-is-code-as-logic.md) —
   **most recent critical refinement**: sema holds code as
   fully-specified logic, not text. Corrects contamination in
   023/024/025. Narrows where rustc is needed and what
   "compile-validity" means as records.
3. [reports/021](../reports/021-criomed-evaluates-lojixd-executes.md)
   — sema IS the evaluation; criomed is sema's engine; lojixd
   is a thin executor. Supersedes 020 §6–§7.
4. [reports/020](../reports/020-lojix-single-daemon.md) —
   lojix shape: one daemon (`lojixd`), one contract
   (`lojix-msg`), no lojix CLI. Supersedes 019 §5–§6.
5. [reports/019](../reports/019-lojix-as-pillar.md) — lojix as
   the artifacts pillar; broad-lojix framing; three-pillar
   model. §5–§6 superseded by 020; lojix-schema proposal
   superseded by 021.
6. [reports/017](../reports/017-architecture-refinements.md) —
   Opus/Derivation shapes, schema-bound patterns, no-Launch,
   no-kind-bytes, tokens. Opus/Derivation type-home reverts
   to nexus-schema per 021.
7. [reports/013](../reports/013-nexus-syntax-proposal.md) —
   delimiter-family matrix (grammar canon).
8. [reports/004](../reports/004-sema-types-for-rust.md) — the
   original (and still correct) framing of sema records for
   Rust code: Fn, Struct, Expr, Type, …. Read with 026 for
   the corrected picture.
9. [reports/022](../reports/022-records-as-evaluation-prior-art.md)
   — prior art for records-as-evaluation (Datomic, DBSP, Salsa,
   Unison, Eve, Prolog).
10. [reports/027](../reports/027-adversarial-review-of-026.md)
    — adversarial critique of 026; the shaky specifics
    surfaced (hash-vs-name refs, ingester scope, edit UX,
    diagnostic spans, cascade cost).
11. [reports/028](../reports/028-doc-propagation-inventory.md)
    — per-repo doc-alignment inventory; items actioned this
    session.
12. [reports/029](../reports/029-ra-chalk-polonius-structural-lessons.md)
    — rust-analyzer / chalk / polonius structural lessons
    stripped of text-layer framing.
13. [reports/030](../reports/030-lojix-transition-plan.md) —
    **critical**: lojix repo is a working monolith today, not
    a spec-only README. Transition plan preserves the
    production CLI while routing toward lojixd.
14. [reports/031](../reports/031-uncertainties-and-open-questions.md)
    — session-close uncertainties list; prioritised decisions.
15. [reports/023](../reports/023-sema-as-rust-checker.md),
    [reports/024](../reports/024-self-hosting-cascade-walkthrough.md),
    [reports/025](../reports/025-sema-schema-inventory.md) —
    the text-layer-contaminated first pass; read the
    correction banners then 026 for corrections.
16. [reports/015](../reports/015-architecture-landscape.md) v4 —
    full architecture synthesis (parts superseded by 017 — read
    after 017 so you know what's current).
17. [reports/016](../reports/016-tier-b-decisions.md) — open
    questions (most answered by 017).
18. `reports/014` — serde-refactor history.
19. `reports/009-binds-and-patterns` — technical reference.

Older reports have been deleted to prevent context poisoning.

## 10 · Update policy

When architecture changes:

1. Update this file first. Keep it prose + diagrams only.
2. Write a new report (`reports/NNN-whatever.md`) describing
   the decision, the alternatives considered, and any concrete
   shapes (types, enums).
3. Update implementation in the affected repos.

If an old report is superseded, **don't edit it** — it stays
as a decision-journey record. The current shape is wherever
this file points.
